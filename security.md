# Security Policy

Security is a serious matter for Tenzir. We want to ensure and maintain a
secure environment for our customers and the open-source community.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security bug in one of our projects, please work with Tenzir's
security team following responsible disclosure principles and these guidelines:

- Do not submit a normal issue or pull request in our public repositories.
  Instead, open a security advisory, which is visible to project maintainers
  only.
- We will review your submission and may follow up for additional details.
- If you have a patch, we will review it and approve it privately; once merged
  it will be publicly disclosed.
- We will keep you informed during our investigation. Feel free to check in for
  a status update.
- Please do not publicly blog or post about the security issue until after we
  have updated the public repository so that other downstream users have an
  opportunity to patch their software.
